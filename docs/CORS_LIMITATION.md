# CORS Implementation Limitation

## Current Status

The CDV service currently has partial CORS support that needs to be completed for production readiness. While the configuration infrastructure has been added, the actual CORS middleware implementation is incomplete.

## What's Implemented

1. **Configuration Structure**: The `Config` struct in `internal/config/config.go` includes a `CORSAllowedOrigins` field
2. **Environment Variable Support**: The service can read `CDV_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` from environment variables
3. **Mux Field**: The `Mux` struct in `internal/server/mux.go` includes a `corsAllowedOrigins` field
4. **Documentation**: The CORS configuration option is documented in `.env.example` and `README.md`

## What's Missing

1. **Complete CORS Middleware**: The `withMiddleware` function in `internal/server/mux.go` has incomplete CORS handling
2. **Proper Initialization**: The `corsAllowedOrigins` field in the `Mux` struct is not being properly initialized from configuration
3. **Comprehensive CORS Headers**: Missing proper handling of all CORS headers including credentials, exposed headers, etc.

## Required Implementation Steps

To complete the CORS implementation, the following steps are needed:

1. **Update NewMux Function**: Modify `internal/server/mux.go` to properly initialize the `corsAllowedOrigins` field:
   ```go
   // Read CORS configuration from environment
   var corsAllowedOrigins []string
   if corsOrigins, exists := os.LookupEnv("CDV_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS"); exists {
       corsAllowedOrigins = strings.Split(corsOrigins, ",")
       // Trim whitespace from each origin
       for i, origin := range corsAllowedOrigins {
           corsAllowedOrigins[i] = strings.TrimSpace(origin)
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Complete withMiddleware Function**: Implement proper CORS handling in the `withMiddleware` function:
   - Handle preflight OPTIONS requests
   - Set appropriate CORS headers for all requests
   - Validate origins against the allowed list
   - Handle wildcard origins securely

3. **Update Main Function**: Pass the CORS configuration to the NewMux function

## Security Considerations

When implementing CORS support, the following security considerations must be addressed:

1. **Default Deny Policy**: By default, CORS should deny all origins (empty list) as per the security requirements
2. **Origin Validation**: Origins must be strictly validated against the allowed list
3. **Wildcard Handling**: Wildcard origins (*) should be handled with caution and only allowed in development environments
4. **Header Restrictions**: Only necessary headers should be exposed through CORS
5. **Credentials Handling**: If credentials are involved, ensure proper CORS configuration

## Production Readiness Impact

The incomplete CORS implementation is a limitation for production deployment because:

1. **Security Requirement**: The requirements specify "deny-all CORS by default"
2. **Browser Compatibility**: Without proper CORS headers, browser-based clients cannot interact with the service
3. **Cross-Origin Requests**: Legitimate cross-origin requests from web applications will be blocked

## Next Steps

To complete the CORS implementation:

1. Implement the missing middleware functionality
2. Test with various CORS scenarios (simple requests, preflight requests, credentials)
3. Verify security compliance with the deny-all policy
4. Update documentation with examples of CORS configuration
5. Add tests for CORS functionality
