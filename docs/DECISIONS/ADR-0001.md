# ADR-0001: Licensing and Repository Posture

Date: 2025-10-08
Status: Accepted

## Context
This repository implements a network service (CDV) for the RegistryAccord protocol. The upstream specs (`registryaccord-specs`) are MIT-licensed content, but services in this repo follow an open-core strategy.

Normative terms (MUST/SHOULD/MAY) follow RFC 2119/8174 and upstream `TERMINOLOGY.md`.

## Decision
- The server code in this repository is licensed under GNU AGPL-3.0.
- A commercial license is available for organizations unable to comply with AGPL obligations (including network use). Contact: legal@registryaccord.org.
- SDKs and client libraries in other repos MAY use permissive licenses to encourage broad adoption.

## Rationale
- Aligns with open-core strategy while keeping core network service improvements reciprocally open.
- Mirrors the README license note and existing `LICENSE` contents (AGPL-3.0).

## Consequences
- Contributions MUST be compatible with AGPL-3.0.
- Public deployments MUST satisfy AGPL network-use requirements.
- README MUST include a “Commercial license available” note and contact.
